        Accessibility should not be a separate course. It doesn&apos;t need to
        be a separate course. At the end of the day it is no different and no
        more complicated than development itself. Learning accessibility should
        be a part of learning HTML and CSS.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        But that&apos;s not how it is. Most courses ignore the subject entirely.
        And we&apos;re left with developers who never bother because they never
        learned the basics.

      <Paragraph>
        Personal rants aside, Amy Kapernick is here to save the day. This course
        is a simple, fast, but has thorough enough coverage of the basics to get
        started with accessibility. There are points through the course where it
        seems Amy sounds a bit tired of talking, I think she could put more
        effort into bringing some energy to the subject. A good, positive
        attitude can be infectious for a subject. But she speaks clearly, has a
        sensible curriculum and it&apos;s plenty to get the job done.

      <Paragraph>
        The course itself could probably be more in-depth, it still seems as if
        when most developers go through this course the lessons taught likely
        won&apos;t stick. I don&apos;t know if this is the fault of this
        particular course or the fault of bigger, more exciting courses for not
        handling accessibility issues throughout all of their projects.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        But I think this is fair to keep in mind. If this course were given more
        meat, maybe had an auditing project to follow along with, it would have
        more appeal.

        information is very much needed. I give{' '}
