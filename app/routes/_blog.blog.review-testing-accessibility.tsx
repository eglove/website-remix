      <Paragraph>
        Accessibility, like testing itself, is an undertaught and too often
        ignored aspect of web development. However it is one of the most
        important. Everyone has a civil right to participate and by not taking
        accessibility seriously we are actively excluding a large portion of the
        population from the ability to use our apps. Which has increasingly
        become a legal battle.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I will start this review by saying that this course, Testing
        Accessibility, is way too expensive. The pricing is very explicitly
        targeting end of year stipends. The content, when looking at the market
        of development courses, is nowhere near worth the advertised price. When
        we talk about actively excluding people from participating, this course
        is guilty by it&apos;s unfair pricing scheme.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        On the content itself, it uses a mixture of text and video. Oftentimes
        the videos will abruptly cut off mid sentence, have some text in
        between, and the next video will pick up again in the middle of that
        sentence. Sometimes the video doesn&apos;t continue at all. Even if
        everything was said, it creates a very unprofessional feel. The editing
        is very poorly done and I don&apos;t get the feeling this course was
        given much attention.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The example app &ldquo;Camspots&rdquo; and the problems around it are
        optimized for the course itself and it&apos;s short videos. You can
        clone the repo and follow along, but the course isn&apos;t designed
        around you as the student. It&apos;s designed around pushing through the
        curriculum. If you try to follow along, you&apos;re not likely to feel
        like you&apos;re doing much. As opposed to an instructor like Wes Bos
        who can make you feel like you&apos;re building something together.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I think in terms of thinking about accessibility, having an entire app
        isn&apos;t entirely necessary. Maybe building out components from
        scratch and focusing on those would be a better experience. There is a
        date picker that Marcy comes back to often, but the instruction on code
        always feels like a side effect, not an integrated piece of the course.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Simply focusing more on what developers should be getting out of this
        course rather than running through some preplanned script would go a
        long way. Handling things like focus styling and keyboard navigation is
        the job of developers, so focusing on simulating that job from start to
        finish in a sort of simulated paired-programming environment gives the
        context needed to learn the material in a way that sticks.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The information in the course itself is very high quality and more
        detailed than I&apos;ve seen in any other course around accessibility.
        Marcy Sutton is clearly an expert on the subject. But her instruction
        skills and ability to put together a development course needs a ton of
        work. That paired with the excessive and unfair price is why I give{' '}
        <A href="https://testingaccessibility.com">
          Testing Accessibility by Marcy Sutton
        </A>{' '}
        a 2 out of 5.
