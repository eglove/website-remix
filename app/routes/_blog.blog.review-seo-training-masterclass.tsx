        Getting into the world of SEO is not a comfortable subject for most
        developers. Marketing in general feels slimy to people who don&apos;t
        have to work at impressing people. There are no white lies or tricking a
        computer into buying something from you with code. That&apos;s partly
        the reason why I believe when developers learn SEO the only thing they
        really learn is server side rendering and title tags. But I think
        it&apos;s important to get the full story and understand what work is
        actually needed to get top placement on search engines.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The first thing I want to address before getting to the course, however,
        is Alex Genadinik. This guy spams the same creepy, most untrustworthy
        profile picture I&apos;ve ever seen everywhere. That awful plain red
        background doesn&apos;t exactly help either. When Alex is on camera in
        his videos he wears a suit jacket and constantly exposes the palms of
        his hands like he&apos;s trying to perform a Jedi mind trick. It&apos;s
        so obvious this guy has read way to many “how to public speaking” Forbes
        articles.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        That being said, I think his SEO course is great. Before I got into web
        development, I was into SEO and web marketing. As I learned web
        development I was very disappointed to see the lack of attention SEO
        gets. It&apos;s just not something I see developers focus on. When they
        do it&apos;s more about mobility, speed and server side rendering to get
        plain HTML on the page. These things do help a lot. Mobility and speed
        arguably help the most. But it&apos;s still important to get into things
        like schema markup, internal linking, and site structure. I would even
        argue it&apos;s important for developers to understand backlink building
        even if that&apos;s not really a part of their job.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        There is often a gap between developers and the people they work with,
        including marketing. So it&apos;s good to have as much overlap knowledge
        as possible. Link building may feel slimy and unethical. This courses
        section on getting edu links made me especially uncomfortable. If I knew
        my company was only hiring students to get University backlinks or
        targeting Wikipedia sources I would have a major issue. These are things
        that should always happen naturally. Do not try to trick or network your
        way into educational resources.

      <Paragraph>
        When learning about SEO you&apos;ll find people who make it their job to
        teach SEO. This is like coming across sales people who don&apos;t have a
        product to sell. So they sell selling. It comes across as awkward, out
        of touch, and simplistic. That&apos;s exactly how this course feels when
        it talks about outdated things like WordPress. Or using GTMetrix and
        Lighthouse as guides for performance.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As developers, we know to ignore these things. Later you&apos;ll learn
        how to properly use Chrome&apos;s performance tab in developer tools as
        well as Reacts flamegraph, bundle analyzers, and other great tools. If
        GTMetrix says you have unused JavaScript on a complex app, you can
        ignore it. In the course Alex complains about Walmart.com&apos;s
        Lighthouse scores, but the website loads very quickly. It is usable in
        very impressive time on a slow 3G connection.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I know from experience that if you load WordPress down with a bunch of
        performance plugins, you can improve your Lighthouse scores at the
        expense of user experience. You&apos;ll soon find yourself severely
        restricting features due to an obsession over basic, and under detailed
        performance tools. You may even find it necessary to use *shudders*
        AMP-HTML. Focus on learning how to balance CSR and SSR, learn cache
        invalidation, component memoization, database optimization and
        algorithms. Don&apos;t worry about GTMetrix.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I think the most key things to learn here are site structure, rich
        snippets and schema markup. You&apos;ll learn a lot about how marketing
        sees websites and what they&apos;re looking for in creating content.
        This is great knowledge to have as developers.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I think Alex Genadinik does a great job of presenting the information.
        He covers seemingly every detail. He is obviously deep in the world of
        SEO and his perspective is a good one to gain if you aren&apos;t
        familiar with that world. The technical knowledge presented isn&apos;t
        great. This isn&apos;t a course for developers, but my concern for
        presenting this course here is that Alex might mislead young developers
        down the wrong path. But it&apos;s an ambitious, huge course that covers
        things that others just don&apos;t which I very much appreciate.
        That&apos;s why I give Alex Genadinik&apos;s{' '}
