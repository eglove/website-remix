        Of every course to have landed on my recommendation list, Valentin Despa
        has the most boring, tired presentation. This course isn&apos;t easy to
        get through. It&apos;s not an exciting subject to begin with, and the
        instructor doesn&apos;t do anything to make it better. That said, it has
        been on and remains on my list of recommended courses. Simply because
        being comfortable with Postman, and more importantly API testing, is a
        vital skill that you won&apos;t find a lot of quality courses for. This
        course is so detailed that it&apos;s referenced in the Postman
        documentation. It goes over every feature you can think of. Variables,
        Chai assertions, mock servers, automating tests, and so on.

        That being said, this is basically a rundown of the Postman
        documentation. I would argue that doing this course is better than
        spending a weekend going through every point in those docs, but
        regardless, the course could be better. For example, by using a large
        project that can be cloned from GitHub and testing a variety of
        endpoints. And using that project throughout the entire duration of the
        course. Instead, it uses some example APIs to build on, but those never
        fully flesh out. Instead of one project that builds on the knowledge
        gained as you go, you hop between small examples for different
        categories. Not to beat a dead horse, but this is the structure of
        following documentation word for word. So you never get a full picture
        of everything you&apos;ve learned. The instructor doesn&apos;t seem to
        have put as much effort into creating a coherent, smooth structure as
        I&apos;ve seen in some of the best courses.

        I can&apos;t complain about that point too much. Even if I consider it
        to be a major issue. This course is a worthwhile investment. And
        probably the best course on Postman out there. Valentin Despa is
        competent and keeps things up to date without too many thrown-in-patch
        videos that feel out of place. Postman is a foundational skill just
        about every developer needs today. And this course will take your
        knowledge beyond most professional devs. A junior developer could take
        the lessons from this course and bring a lot of value to a company that
        doesn&apos;t realize how useful Postman is. (And this is most
        companies.)

        Despite poor delivery and a follow the docs structure, this is a
        competent course on a good subject so I&apos;m giving it a 4 out of 5.
