      <Paragraph>RTC courses fill a gap.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        There are a few web development courses that go over interviewing. But
        always from the algorithm perspective, they&apos;re never great at
        covering different situations. There are a few that build a portfolio,
        but as a project, they don&apos;t teach you a process for improving on
        an existing portfolio so that it really stands out as something unique.
        There&apos;s a couple of mentions of freelancing here and there, but no
        real help in getting started.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        That&apos;s where RTC has come to save the day. I got into web
        development from trying to maximize the SEO and performance of WordPress
        sites, handing out free audits to try to get jobs. That&apos;s what
        eventually led me to move away from WordPress and into the JamStack with
        backend CMS&apos; like Sanity. It&apos;s that knowledge that got me
        started that I take for granted today.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <span className="font-bold">
          So I really appreciate RTC focusing on this valuable knowledge that
          other courses just don&apos;t really cover.
        </span>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <span className="font-bold">
          However, there&apos;s one major flaw to her courses. They are very
          short.
        </span>{' '}
        Every page has the same note in bold letters:
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        “For every ten minutes of video, you can expect to spend between 1-3
        hours doing hands-on work outside the classroom.”
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <span className="font-bold">
          This is an expectation you should have for every course you take.
        </span>{' '}
        “Outside the classroom?” I think the copy here is going for an
        unrealistic image. These courses are 1-3 hours of tips and tricks. There
        are no full, detailed courses on the entire process.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Don&apos;t get me wrong. The subjects here are hard to teach online.
        It&apos;s probably why no one else is doing it. With a course on
        freelancing, for example, all any instructor can do is point you to the
        right resources, give a few tips, and walk you through what the tools
        you&apos;ll use look like. So yes, most of the work will be in applying
        that. But again, you should have the same expectation for every course.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The course, or the instructor, does not get credit for how you applied
        what they taught. Those 1-3 hours doing “hands-on” work “outside the
        classroom” are all you.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        And by that I mean, RTC places way too much value on these very short
        courses. $80 for a one-time purchase of one course. $25 monthly for all
        courses, and $200 yearly.{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">None of those price points are fair.</span>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        It is just reasonable enough to pay for one month, power through all the
        courses and take lots of notes, and immediately unsubscribe. At the
        moment, that gets you 12 hours of content. That doesn&apos;t get you
        720-2160 hours as the copy says.{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">
          That&apos;s your time, that&apos;s your work, that&apos;s 100% your
          value, RTC doesn&apos;t get to charge you for that.
        </span>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Because they are teaching subjects that aren&apos;t often covered, and
        because the sections of mock interviews or mock conversations are well
        put together, these courses will remain on my recommended list.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        But my advice is to{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">
          subscribe, knock out the courses and take notes, then unsubscribe to
          avoid paying an unreasonable amount of money
        </span>{' '}
        .
