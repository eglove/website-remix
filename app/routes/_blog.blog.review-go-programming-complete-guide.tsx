        Zero To Mastery hasn&apos;t been doing well. Ever since Andrei Neagoie
        decided to make ZTM more than just his courses, quality has been
        dropping with every new course.

      <Paragraph>
        Jayson Lennon is the instructor behind the newest Rust and Go courses
        and the formula for both is the same. He reads off some powerpoint
        slides describing the code he&apos;s about to write. Then in the next
        video he writes that code. The code, by the way, never applies to an
        application it&apos;s just simple examples to cover basic concepts.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        It&apos;s like watching someone read the documentation and typing it
        out. It doesn&apos;t make sense. Imagine if this is how you learned a
        new language. You visit the documentation website. Read a paragraph,
        then type it into an editor. Then move on. It&apos;s not only a slow and
        boring way to read docs, but it&apos;s not a useful strategy.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For people who learn best by video, this is not helpful. For people who
        learn best by reading text, they&apos;re better off reading the
        documentation. This course doesn&apos;t seem to be for anyone.

      <Paragraph>
        The courses that make it to my recommended list and get a 5 out of 5
        rating are taught by charismatic, experienced devs and usually
        intelligently integrate concepts into large projects.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For the conceptual courses like Advanced JavaScript or Stephen
        Grider&apos;s TypeScript course, the concepts are still covered in code.
        Always explained in the context of code you might actually write.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        By the time I got to the mid point of Lennon&apos;s Go course I
        didn&apos;t feel like I was learning anything. To be fair, this course
        is obviously geared towards people learning to program for the very
        first time. All of ZTM&apos;s language courses are. There is simply
        nothing for intermediate to advanced developers beyond vanilla
        JavaScript.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        But even for a beginner, this is the classic example of the sort of
        course that leaves people bored and unmotivated. Because the course
        itself is boring and unmotivated.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        It&apos;s disappointing, but as someone who once dropped $800 on a
        lifetime membership to Zero To Mastery, I have to start recommending to
        avoid the site altogether. Get the few good courses they have on Udemy,
        don&apos;t waste your time on the subscription.

      <Paragraph>
        There&apos;s not a lot of Go courses out there, and this may be good
        enough if you HAVE to learn Go right now. Because of that, Jayson
        Lennon&apos;s{' '}
