        Colt Steele has a talent for approaching boring topics. It&apos;s easier
        to create a fun and exciting course when it&apos;s writing out small
        portfolio projects or doing an ecommerce store. But Git and the Linux
        Command line are not exactly exciting. Colt&apos;s{' '}

        the course to take on the subject.

        Without a doubt the course will be going on my recommended list.
        However, it may seem odd how low on that list it will be placed. I will
        not be recommending to learn the linux command line early as I do with
        Postman and Git. The reason is simple, get used to working with Windows
        tools (PowerShell) and a proper IDE first.

        Courses on that list will help with what&apos;s needed for the course.
        Advanced usage of the linux command line will not become relevant until
        you&apos;re working with Docker images and CI/CD. Until then, don&apos;t
        worry about Linux at all.
