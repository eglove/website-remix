      other than that it&apos;s necessary. Git is another one of those everyday
      skills every developer needs to know, but sadly, most developers never
      take the time to learn properly. This course will take you beyond add,
      commit and push. It will explain the weird parts of git (like HEAD and how
      it works under the hood), cover visualizing diffs, stashing, amending,
      restore, reset, revert, SSH (for GitHub), managing conflicts, reflog,
      tagging, and my all-time favorite, interactive rebase. Learning all of
      these will make sure that as a developer, you can pull yourself out of any
      tricky situation and make sure you&apos;re handling version control
      correctly. It will put you ahead of most professional developers on git
      and put you in a position where you&apos;ll never fear any version control
      scenario again. I think this is the best Git course out there. Colt
      Steele&apos;s delivery is as always not the most exciting, but good enough
      to keep you engaged. Because of this courses position as the best course
      out there on Git, I give it a 5 out of 5.
