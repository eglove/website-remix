        Andrei Neagoi&apos;s courses around React are starting to age, and
        they&apos;re not getting the updates they need. I removed his Complete
        Web Developer course from my recommended list for many reasons,
        including using a deprecated API for a project and not properly
        including hooks. Which has been the standard way to write React apps for
        at least two years. Instead, he patched the course with an explainer
        video saying, “You might still see React classes in the wild, but
        we&apos;ll still use them here.” Then tacked on hooks as an appendix
        item.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        When it comes to his Junior to Senior course, it&apos;s a similar story.
        Except the course was already patched with an extra hooks section after
        the project was complete last year. Now, for that same project, when
        using create react app for the first time, React defaults to using
        functional components. (And hooks from there.) But instead of updating
        the course, Andrei changed a total of 5 videos (that&apos;s the entire
        “2022” update) to have students convert that functional component that
        React defaults to into a class component. He then spends some time
        ranting against hooks. Again, throwing out every argument he can think
        of, except the truth. He says other languages use classes, so students
        should learn them here. This is ridiculous, React is not a good place to
        learn object-oriented programming. Maybe typescript or node, but the
        comparison between React classes and a traditional class is a bit of a
        stretch. He also says students should learn about classes because it was
        the way things used to be done. That&apos;s absolutely fair, I like
        that, but don&apos;t build the whole project with classes only to tack
        on an update at the end. A third argument he throws out is that there is
        a “movement” to avoid hooks. There is not. Hooks are the standard way to
        write React apps today.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I don&apos;t know why Andrei has been so resistant to hooks for the last
        few years. I think when you take other things into consideration like a
        deprecated API in the web developer course, and the fact that Andrei
        rants against hooks at the start of a project in Junior to Senior only
        to update the project to hooks after it&apos;s deployed, this all tells
        me he&apos;s just not updating his courses.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I knew when Andrei started bringing on other instructors to Zero to
        Mastery and pumping out 3/5 courses like Academind, his own courses
        would start to suffer. And that&apos;s what&apos;s happening. I&apos;m
        going to make a total guess and say he no longer has the time to
        properly care for his courses because he&apos;s trying to create a
        business. But the courses his business produces tend to be mediocre.
        Because they&apos;re pumped out at a very fast rate by instructors who
        frankly aren&apos;t that good at teaching.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        OK... let&apos;s settle down and talk about the positive really quick.
        The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer covers a lot of stuff. Image
        optimization, critical render path, code splitting, tree shaking,
        PWA&apos;s, testing, TypeScript, server-side rendering, security, code
        analysis, Docker, Redis, sessions, JWT, AWS, CDN, caching, GZip, CI/CD,
        and lots of stuff in between. Even if this course doesn&apos;t get many
        updates, these other subjects haven&apos;t changed much in the last 5
        years.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Andrei Neagoi is NOT the guy to go to to learn React anymore. This is
        why my recommend list makes sure to keep a variety of instructors and
        schools to learn from. (I know it&apos;s heavy on ZTM, that is
        changing.) So if you ignore the fact that the React project is out of
        date, you can still get a huge wealth of knowledge out of this course.
        All things that will put you ahead of many, if not most developers.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        So this is a very competent course overall. Andrei&apos;s presentation
        skills are great as always. The course follows what feels like a linear
        storyline to build up your knowledge incrementally. It&apos;s not just
        one random subject after another that never connects. Everything builds
        on the previous.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        There&apos;s one thing that saves this course entirely from a worse
        score and being removed from the recommended list entirely. The React
        section is optional. So I&apos;m going to put a big note on this.{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">PLEASE SKIP THE REACT SECTION</span>. There
        are courses that teach React properly. This particular course gives a
        general overview of a lot of subjects you should have an awareness of.
        What it does not appropriately cover is React. And you will not learn
        anything about classes by following that section as Andrei argues. That
        section is the result of laziness and nothing more.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Given the high quality of everything else and the fact that the React
        section is not required, ZTM&apos;s Junior to Senior Web Developer just
        barely eeks out a 4 out of 5.
